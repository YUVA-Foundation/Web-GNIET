We also undertake lifelong learning to gain multidisilinary knowledge through self study, experimental learning, through the adoption of varied conventional and non conventional traditional and digital modes of learning.
                    We aim to achieve and sustain excellence in teaching and  enrich local, national and international communities through our research.

            Business development managers are strategists, networkers and marketers. Their job is to grow companies,
            mainly by identifying and capturing new revenue opportunities. They may find new customers, tap into new
            markets, or improve a company's digital presence or marketing of products. It's a role where you want people
            to listen to what you have to say. An MBA program allows you to develop business strategy skills and add a
            highly regarded qualification to your CV or resume.

            <b> Entrepreneur</b> <br>
            People sometimes debate whether getting an MBA helps you to be an entrepreneur. If you've just invented a
            new technology with worldwide application or a gadget that will change housework forever, maybe don't bother
            with formal study. But, otherwise, an MBA may be a good idea. Being an effective entrepreneur requires some
            serious business skills. You can pick these up with an MBA, especially if the course is geared towards
            entrepreneurship. Plus, having an MBA helps you win the belief and confidence of prospective investors and
            business partners.
            <br> <b> Job titles:</b> business owner, company co-founder, company director, company founder, company
            owner, entrepreneur, I run a ... business, serial entrepreneur. <br><br>
            <b>Finance Manager </b> <br>
            Understanding accounting and numbers is one of the requirements to be a finance manager. But another is to
            use financial insight to guide business spending and investment decisions. For that reason, an MBA can often
            be better value than a Master of Finance or similar. A financial expert with an MBA is someone people are
            inclined to trust with strategic financial management.
            <br> <b> Job titles:</b> commercial finance manager, corporate services manager, executive finance manager,
            finance consultant, finance director, finance manager, group finance manager, project finance partner,
            regional finance manager.<br><br>
            <b>General Manager</b> <br>
            The term "general manager" is typically applied to people senior enough to be managing managers.
            Competitions for GM positions is high because the tasks are, indeed, general: such as supervising, managing
            and leading people.
            Management and leadership are also core subjects in Master of Business Administration programs. Online MBA
            programs are usually adapted to suit busy senior managers such as general managers. With an MBA to your
            name, employers know you've learned management principles and are committed to a career in the field.
            <br> <b> Job titles:</b> general manager, general manager of finance and administration, general manager
            operations, general manager people and culture.<br><br>
            <b>Industry Specialist Manager</b> <br>
            Many professionals reach a point in their career when their best prospects for a promotion or higher salary
            are on the management rather than technical side of the industry. In these situations, an MBA can be
            invaluable for demonstrating management skills and winning management roles. It's a similar situation if you
            want to shift into consulting. Here, an MBA builds your business administration skills and provides a
            credential that gets noticed by prospective clients.
            <br> <b> Job titles:</b> construction manager, engineering manager, health services administrator, IT
            consultant, IT project manager.<br><br>
            <b> Marketing Manager</b> <br>
            Moving into marketing management is a natural career progression for marketing specialists. As you mature,
            your experience and knowledge can be better deployed in planning and oversight of marketing (instead of
            doing specific campaign jobs). MBA graduates are advantaged because the degree indicates you're capable of
            planning, budgeting and leading. Marketing is also a core study topic in most MBA programs.
            <br> <b> Job titles:</b> campaign manager, commercial sales manager, digital marketing manager, marketing
            director, marketing manager, marketing operations director, senior marketing manager.<br><br>
            <b>Operations Manager</b> <br>

            Operations managers oversee the "doing" of business activities. They may look after a manufacturing process,
            the delivery of a service, or a facility such as a theme park. An MBA allows you to transition from helping
            run operations to taking a lead role. As well, it means you have transferable skills (such as business
            strategy and managing teams) needed in any operations role.
            <br> <b> Job titles:</b> manager customer delivery, manager operations, operations manager, production team
            manager, regional operations manager, transport operations manager, warehouse manager.<br><br>
            <b>Product Manager</b> <br>
            When employers hire a product manager, they are usually looking for someone who is good at everything.
            Having an MBA can be a big advantage. A product manager optimises profits by ensuring: high production
            standards, cost effectiveness, and that the product meets customer needs and is well marketed. Good business
            skills and an ability to work with different people, from company executives to production workers, are
            normal job requirements.
            <br> <b> Job titles:</b> assistant product manager (graduate position), brand manager, clinical product
            manager, global product manager, product manager, product manager asset management, senior product
            manager.<br><br>
            <b>Program Manager</b> <br>
            A program manager is responsible for a specific activity that may have a separate budget and is different
            from other aspects of the business. Because programs vary in character and can be unique, a program manager
            needs to be adaptable. MBA holders are favoured for program management jobs because they have a broad skill
            set that includes team management and business administration. An MBA can be a real career booster because
            it qualifies you for any job that doesn't require industry-specific technical skills.
            <br> <b> Job titles:</b> business program manager, digital program manager, head of services and programs,
            principal program manager, program manager, program operations manager.<br><br>
            <b>Sales Manager</b> <br>
            To be a good sales manager, you need to have the knack of selling. That way, you can coach and mentor your
            team towards higher sales volumes. But an MBA is another valuable asset. Especially with more senior
            positions, being a sales manager requires you to have skills in financial management, strategic planning and
            resource allocation. An MBA teaches those skills and gives you a competitive advantage in recruitment
            processes.

            regional sales manager, retail manager, sales director, sales executive, sales manager.
